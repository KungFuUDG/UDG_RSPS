[02/09/13 18:46:10] : We could just change the rewards to something else
[02/09/13 18:46:25] : Like only weapons and items
[02/09/13 18:46:35] : We could also change the xp rate
[02/09/13 18:46:47] : One steal in theiving gives you 23 levels
[02/09/13 18:47:01] : You do?
[02/09/13 18:47:04] : Uhh
[02/09/13 18:47:16] : Oh
[02/09/13 18:47:19] : One sec

[02/09/13 18:48:54] : Okay one sec

[02/09/13 19:01:36] : hahaha
[02/09/13 19:01:51] : I tried dance all
[02/09/13 19:02:09] : Because you started fighting
[02/09/13 19:06:45] : There is literally not one place in the code where img=7 can be found
[02/09/13 19:06:54] : This makes no sense
[02/09/13 19:07:09] : I'll keep checking
[02/09/13 19:21:57] : Sorry
[02/09/13 19:21:58] : Umm

[02/09/13 19:23:46] : I see it fine
[02/09/13 19:24:06] : Can you see it in trade?
[02/09/13 19:24:21] : Must be your client
[02/09/13 19:24:25] : Maybe recompile it?
[02/09/13 19:24:27] : And try again
[02/09/13 19:24:53] : I know
[02/09/13 19:24:59] : I'll do that in a second
[02/09/13 19:25:09] : Just working out your owner sprite thing
[02/09/13 19:26:41] : Oh

[02/09/13 19:27:29] : No like
[02/09/13 19:27:33] : It's harcoded in
[02/09/13 19:27:52] : Umm
[02/09/13 19:27:55] : Maybe not
[02/09/13 19:28:05] : I can probably work a fix to it
[02/09/13 19:28:12] : Another thing
[02/09/13 19:28:19] : It's in the client
[02/09/13 19:28:30] : So I would need to rezip and then give you a new client
[02/09/13 19:28:41] : Coll cool
[02/09/13 19:30:25] : No problem
[02/09/13 19:32:19] : Say something

[02/09/13 19:40:50] : Looks easy
[02/09/13 19:41:22] : Probably a major coding session
[02/09/13 19:41:46] : And depending on what it would do, new items, new item models and animation
[02/09/13 19:42:19] : What skill were you thinking of?
[02/09/13 19:42:31] : h

[02/09/13 20:03:08] : It's a lot of work but I'm fine with doing it
[02/09/13 20:03:21] : The only hard part is getting all the right coordinates
[02/09/13 20:03:41] : For the theiving stalls and everythign

[02/09/13 21:04:22] : Canyou make a google document for all the things you want me to do?
[02/09/13 21:04:33] : It makes it easier than me remembering

[02/09/13 21:09:23] : Or you're doing it wrong
[02/09/13 21:11:35] : Looks like this part is just broken completely
[02/09/13 21:11:48] : Even if you get across there would be no where to go
[02/09/13 21:14:48] : I can't?
